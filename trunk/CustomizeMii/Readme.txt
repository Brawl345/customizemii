CustomizeMii is a 100% legal custom Channel creator for the Wii.
It's completely written by myself (some parts are based on other 100% legal codes).
Use legal Base WADs to create your own legal custom Homebrew Channels.
The .NET Framework 2.0 is required to run this application!

For any further information, see: http://customizemii.googlecode.com
Please use the Issue Tracker there to report any occuring bugs.

Please Note: This is a clone of the original Channel Making Application by icefire / Xuzz.
I decided to do it, because Xuzz gave up the work on his application and
the last beta Version he left creates bricking WADs.

Disclaimer:

Editing WAD files can result in a brick of your Wii.
Only use these features if you have a bricksafe Wii, meaning either Preloader or
BootMii/boot2 is installed, and if you know what you're doing.

This application comes without any express or implied warranty.
