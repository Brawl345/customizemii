*CustomizeMii* is a 100% legal custom Channel creator for the Wii.<br>
It's completely written by myself (some parts are based on other 100% legal codes).<br>
Use legal Base WADs to create your own legal custom Homebrew Channels.<br>
The .NET Framework 2.0 is required to run this application!<br>
<br>
For any further information, see: http://customizemii.googlecode.com<br>
Please use the Issue Tracker there to report any occuring bugs.<br>
<br>
Please Note: This is a clone of the original Channel Making Application by icefire / Xuzz.<br>
I decided to do it, because Xuzz gave up the work on his application and<br>
the last beta Version he left creates bricking WADs.<br>
